        <h1>Tasty Lasagna Recipe</h1>

        <p><strong>Descrption:</strong> is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
             A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere.
             Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
        <ul> <strong>Ingredients</strong>
            <li>½ pound ground pork</li>

            <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
                
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
                
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
                
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

        </ul>
             <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>Directions
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
